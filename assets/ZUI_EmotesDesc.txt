The project description must contain these facts:
- Features offered by the project.
- How those features affect a user's experience.

ZUI_Emotes is a small fun addon that lets users select emotes! Includes a selection menu of all in-game emotes!



Emote selection is divided between 3 panels

- Animation emotes (all emotes with an animation)

- Voice emotes (all emotes with a voice-line)

- Other emotes (emotes without an animation or voice-line)



Click any emote to show an emotion and interact with friends!

With every emote in the game at the click of a button you will have access to a new way of communicating.

ZUI_Emotes also helps you communicate with the enemy faction. (If you would even want that!)



Includes locale support. The only current locale is enUS.
